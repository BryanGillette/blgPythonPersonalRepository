Using pull requests

Pull requests let you tell others about 
changes you've pushed 
to a repository on GitHub. 

Once a pull request is sent, 
interested parties can 
review the set of changes, 
discuss potential modifications, and even
push follow-up commits if necessary.

This guide walks through 
the process of sending a
hypothetical pull request and 
using the 
various 
code review and 
management tools to take the change to completion.
